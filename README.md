# CaT-FeII-emission
results from photoionisation models run with CLOUDY v17.01 (Ferland et al. 2017)

Parameters used to compute the models and subsequent details can be found in *[Panda et al. 2020 (Paper I)](https://www.arxiv.org)*


The shape of the continuum for I Zw 1 is obtained from the *[NED database](http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/datasearch?search_type=Photo_id&objid=2195&objname=UGC%2000545&img_stamp=YES&hconst=73.0&omegam=0.27&omegav=0.73&corr_z=1&of=table)*. 

The fluxes are reported in cgs units using the conversion: ([X erg/cm^2/s/Hz] = 1.0E-23 [Y Jy] )
